Chapter 24 on virtualization, including example code references, drawn from the *UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook, Fifth Edition*:

### 24.1 VIRTUAL VERNACULAR
Virtualization refers to running multiple OS instances on the same physical hardware. The core concept relies on hypervisors, which manage resource distribution among guest OSs while keeping them isolated. Key terminologies include:
- **Type 1 (Bare-metal)**: Hypervisors that run directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
- **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Hypervisors that operate on top of an OS (e.g., VirtualBox).

### 24.2 VIRTUALIZATION WITH LINUX

**Xen and KVM** are prominent open-source hypervisors for Linux:
- **Xen**: Initially developed at the University of Cambridge, it offers paravirtualization and full virtualization with minimal overhead. The main components include `dom0` (privileged domain) and `domU` (guest domains). Example setup involves configuring `/etc/xen` files and using `virt-install` for provisioning.
- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**: Integrated into the Linux kernel, KVM supports full virtualization using Intel VT/AMD-V extensions. Commands like `virsh` manage virtual environments, and the `virt-install` utility provisions VMs.

**Example KVM Installation**:
```bash
virt-install --name ubuntu-vm --ram 1024 --disk path=~/ubuntu.img,size=12 --vcpus 1 --os-type linux --os-variant ubuntu20.04 --cdrom /path/to/ubuntu.iso
```

### 24.3 FREEBSD BHYVE

**bhyve** is FreeBSD's native hypervisor, supporting BSD, Linux, and Windows. It’s limited by hardware support and lacks some features of more mature platforms.

### 24.4 VMWARE
**VMware ESXi** is a widely used type 1 hypervisor known for its enterprise features like advanced VM management and live migration. Free versions are available, but advanced functions often require licensing.

### 24.5 VIRTUALBOX

**Oracle VM VirtualBox** is a type 2 hypervisor popular for development and testing due to its cross-platform compatibility and ease of use. It provides a GUI and CLI (`VBoxManage`) for managing VMs. While convenient, it’s less suitable for production.

**Example VirtualBox Command**:
```bash
VBoxManage createvm --name "TestVM" --register
VBoxManage modifyvm "TestVM" --memory 2048 --cpus 2 --nic1 nat
VBoxManage startvm "TestVM"
```

### 24.6 PACKER

**Packer** automates image creation across multiple platforms. Configuration files are written in JSON format, with **builders** for image creation and **provisioners** for software setup.

**Example Packer Template**:
```json
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "virtualbox-iso",
    "iso_url": "http://example.com/ubuntu.iso",
    "iso_checksum": "1234567890abcdef",
    "disk_size": 10000
  }],
  "provisioners": [{
    "type": "shell",
    "script": "setup-script.sh"
  }]
}
```

### 24.7 VAGRANT

**Vagrant**, from HashiCorp, provides consistent development environments. It simplifies VM creation using a `Vagrantfile` to define settings and provisions.

**Example Vagrantfile**:
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo Hello, World"
end
```
