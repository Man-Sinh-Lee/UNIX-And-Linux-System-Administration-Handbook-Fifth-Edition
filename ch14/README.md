### Chapter 14: Physical Networking - Summary with Examples

#### **14.1 Ethernet: The Swiss Army Knife of Networking**
- **Overview**: Ethernet dominates local area networks (LANs) worldwide, evolving from 3 Mb/s to gigabit and beyond.
- **Signaling**: Follows CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol to handle network traffic.
- **Topology**:
  - Physical segments consist of hosts connected to switches.
  - Logical segments allow unicast, multicast, and broadcast communication.

Example:
```bash
# Display Ethernet interface details
ethtool eth0
```

#### **14.2 Wireless: Ethernet for Nomads**
- **Standards**:
  - **802.11g**: Up to 54 Mb/s at 2.4 GHz.
  - **802.11n**: Up to 600 Mb/s at 2.4 or 5 GHz.
  - **802.11ac**: Up to 1 Gb/s throughput.
- **Security**:
  - Replace WEP with WPA2 for modern security.
  - Use VLANs for guest access.

Example:
```bash
# Connect to a wireless network
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "YourSSID" key s:YourPassword
```

---

#### **14.3 SDN: Software-Defined Networking**
- **Concept**: Decouples control (management) from the data plane (packet forwarding) for flexibility.
- **Applications**:
  - Cloud providers integrate SDN for seamless resource management.
  - Enterprises can dynamically adjust network topology for performance and security.

Example:
```bash
# Configure an SDN network using OpenFlow
ovs-vsctl add-br br0
```

---

#### **14.4 Network Testing and Debugging**
- **Tools**:
  - **Cable Analyzers**: Identify wiring issues.
  - **Packet Sniffers**: Capture and analyze traffic (e.g., Wireshark).
- **Strategy**:
  - Break down the network into segments.
  - Isolate problematic devices or cables.

Example:
```bash
# Capture network traffic on a specific interface
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```

---

#### **14.5 Building Wiring**
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use Category 6a cables for durability and performance.
  - Install extra connections for future-proofing.
  - Follow TIA/EIA-606-B for labeling and documentation.
- **Security**: Ensure return air plenums and firewalls comply with safety standards.

---

#### **14.6 Network Design Issues**
- **Considerations**:
  - Align logical design with building architecture.
  - Plan for scalability by installing additional fiber or cables.
  - Use subnets and routers to manage congestion and isolate traffic.

---

#### **14.7 Management Issues**
- **Centralization**:
  - Core backbone supports multiple departmental subnets.
  - Documentation and regular updates ensure smooth operation.
- **Distribution**:
  - Use switches and routers to isolate faults and manage traffic locally.

---

#### **14.8 Recommended Vendors**
- **Cabling**: Siemon, Panduit.
- **Wireless**: Ubiquiti, Meraki (enterprise-grade solutions).
- **Testing Tools**: Fluke for cable analysis, AirMagnet for wireless.

---

#### **14.9 Recommended Reading**
- Deep dive into Ethernet evolution and SDN concepts using books like:
  - *TCP/IP Illustrated* by W. Richard Stevens.
  - *Network Warrior* by Gary A. Donahue.
