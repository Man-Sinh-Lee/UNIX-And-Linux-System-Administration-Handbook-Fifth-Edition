Here is a detailed summary of Chapter 26 on Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), including example codes:

### 26.1 CI/CD ESSENTIALS
CI/CD represents a set of practices aimed at automating software integration and delivery:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** involves merging code frequently into a shared repository, with builds and tests automatically triggered to validate changes.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** automates the deployment of builds to non-production environments.
- **Continuous Deployment** extends CD by automating the release process to production.

### 26.2 PIPELINES
A CI/CD pipeline is structured into sequential **stages**:
- **Build Stage**: Transforms the code into deployable software artifacts.
- **Test Stage**: Runs automated tests to ensure quality.
- **Deploy Stage**: Deploys the code to various environments.

**Example Pipeline Command**:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 26.3 JENKINS: THE OPEN SOURCE AUTOMATION SERVER
Jenkins is a widely-used CI/CD server:
- **Running Jenkins**: Simple setups use Docker to launch Jenkins quickly:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
  ```
- **Pipeline Management**: Jenkins pipelines are defined in `Jenkinsfile`, allowing CI/CD processes to be coded and version-controlled.

### 26.4 CI/CD IN PRACTICE
An example project might include:
- **Tools**: GitHub for source code, Jenkins for orchestration, and tools like Packer and Terraform for deployment automation.
- **Stages**: The pipeline could involve building, running unit tests, creating an image, and deploying to environments such as DigitalOcean VMs.

**Example Unit Test**:
```go
func TestExample(t *testing.T) {
    result := ExampleFunction(5)
    if result != expectedValue {
        t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d", expectedValue, result)
    }
}
```

### 26.5 CONTAINERS AND CI/CD
Containers simplify CI/CD by:
- Running CI/CD agents inside containers.
- Using containers as build environments to standardize dependencies and reduce conflicts.
- Creating container images as build artifacts for consistent deployment.

**Container Workflow**:
1. **Build in a container**.
2. **Create an image** with the application.
3. **Push the image** to a registry.
4. **Deploy** using platforms like Kubernetes.

- *Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk* by Paul M. Duvall.
- Official documentation and resources on Jenkins and container technologies like Docker.
