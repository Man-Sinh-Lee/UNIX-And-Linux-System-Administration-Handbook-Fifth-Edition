Chapter 25 on containers, including example code references from the *UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook, Fifth Edition*:

### 25.1 BACKGROUND AND CORE CONCEPTS
Containers isolate processes with a private root filesystem and namespace, using shared resources of the host OS without modification. Core Linux kernel features involved include:
- **Namespaces** for process isolation (e.g., mounts, network).
- **Control groups (cgroups)** to limit resource usage.
- **Capabilities** for kernel operation permissions.
- **seccomp** for fine-grained system call access control.

**Example Concept**: Container images act like templates and rely on union filesystems, offering a copy-on-write strategy to optimize space.

### 25.2 DOCKER: THE OPEN SOURCE CONTAINER ENGINE
Docker's engine, written in Go, manages containers and supports modular components for storage and networking. The Docker architecture includes:
- `docker` command for client interactions.
- `dockerd`, the daemon for container management and networking.

**Example Command**:
```bash
docker run -d --name mycontainer ubuntu:latest
```

**Security Note**: Use `docker inspect` to validate volumes to avoid unneeded space usage.

### 25.3 CONTAINERS IN PRACTICE
Effective use of containers involves:
- Avoid running `sshd`; use `docker exec` for shell access.
- Prefer environment variables for configurations (`-e` option).
- Emphasize container disposability and automation.

**Example Logging**:
```bash
docker logs mycontainer
```

**Troubleshooting**: Use `docker system prune` to clean unused resources.

### 25.4 CONTAINER CLUSTERING AND MANAGEMENT
For distributed deployments, orchestration tools are essential:
- **Kubernetes** is the industry standard with services like API server and Kubelet.
- **Docker Swarm** for simpler clustering.
- **Other Options**: AWS ECS, Mesos.

Orchestrators provide load balancing, resource scheduling, and health monitoring.
