### Chapter 4: Process Control - Detailed Summary with Examples

#### **4.1 Components of a Process**
- **Process Abstraction**: A running program represented by an address space and kernel data structures. 
- **Kernel Data Structures**:
  - **Address Space Map**: Tracks memory usage.
  - **Execution Priority**: Determines CPU scheduling.
  - **File/Network Resources**: Tracks open files and sockets.
  - **Signal Mask**: Records blocked signals.

Example:
```bash
# Display process details, including PID and resources
ps aux | grep <process_name>
```

---

#### **4.2 The Life Cycle of a Process**
1. **Creation**: A parent process uses `fork` to spawn a child process.
2. **Execution**: The child process often calls `exec` to replace its code with a new program.
3. **Termination**: Processes end with an `_exit` call, providing a status code.
4. **Parent Acknowledgment**: The parent process retrieves the childâ€™s status with `wait`.

Example:
```bash
# Terminate a process
kill -SIGTERM <PID>
```

---

#### **4.3 `ps`: Monitor Processes**
- The `ps` command displays active processes, including their PID, CPU, memory usage, and more.
- Variants:
  - `ps aux`: Lists all processes.
  - `ps lax`: Provides technical details like parent PID (PPID).

Example:
```bash
# Find a process by name
ps aux | grep <process_name>
```

---

#### **4.4 Interactive Monitoring with `top`**
- Real-time process monitoring, showing resource usage, load averages, and system health.
- Interactive features:
  - `k`: Kill a process.
  - `r`: Change priority.

Example:
```bash
# Run top to monitor system
top
# Show individual CPU usage
top -1
```

---

#### **4.5 `nice` and `renice`: Influence Scheduling Priority**
- **Nice Values**: Ranges from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest priority).
- **Commands**:
  - `nice`: Set priority at process creation.
  - `renice`: Adjust priority of a running process.

Example:
```bash
# Start a process with low priority
nice -n 10 <command>
# Change the priority of an existing process
renice -n 5 -p <PID>
```

---

#### **4.6 The `/proc` Filesystem**
- Virtual filesystem providing process and system information.
- Useful Directories:
  - `/proc/<PID>`: Contains process-specific details.
  - `/proc/cpuinfo`: CPU details.
  - `/proc/meminfo`: Memory statistics.

Example:
```bash
# View command-line arguments for a process
cat /proc/<PID>/cmdline
```

---

#### **4.7 `strace` and `truss`: Trace Signals and System Calls**
- Tools to debug and trace process behavior.
- **`strace`**: Monitors system calls in Linux.
- **`truss`**: Equivalent in UNIX systems.

Example:
```bash
# Trace a process
strace -p <PID>
```

---

#### **4.8 Runaway Processes**
- Runaway processes monopolize system resources.
- Identification:
  - Use `top` or `ps` to spot high resource consumers.
- Resolution:
  - Lower priority with `renice`.
  - Suspend or kill with `kill`.

Example:
```bash
# Suspend a process
kill -STOP <PID>
```

---

#### **4.9 Periodic Processes**
- Managed using `cron` jobs or `systemd` timers.
- **`cron`**: Executes tasks based on a schedule defined in `crontab`.
- **`systemd` Timers**: Modern alternative with advanced features.

Example:
```bash
# Add a cron job
crontab -e
# Create a systemd timer
systemctl enable my_timer.timer
```
